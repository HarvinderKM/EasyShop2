### Project Overview:
This capstone project is an e-commerce application for a company named **EasyShop**. I assumed the role of a backend developer to enhance an existing online store. 

## The application was developed using the following: 
- SpringBoot for backend server 
- MySQL for database storage 
- Visual Code Studio for front end 
- Front end website was provided as a starter code 
- Postman 2 test all API endpoints
